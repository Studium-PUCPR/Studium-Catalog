# Continuous Project State Tracking (`AGENTS.md`) & Engineering Directives

## 1. Continuous State Tracking (`./AGENTS.md`)
1. **Canonical File Path:** The versioned project state file is located at `./AGENTS.md` (relative to this repository's root).
2. **Read on Startup:** Always read and keep the architectural decisions, coding standards, and current state in `./AGENTS.md` in mind when answering questions or writing code.
3. **Cross-Project Reference Check (Mandatory):** If an agent is working across repositories or using another project (such as `Studium-Users` or `Studium-Infra`) as a reference, the agent **MUST** check if an `AGENTS.md` exists in their own project (and create or update it according to that project's rules).
4. **Post-Prompt Check (Mandatory & Silent):** After **every user prompt**, check whether:
   - A new architectural or design conclusion was reached,
   - A requirement or workflow was clarified, or
   - Any code, database schema, configuration, or endpoint was added, modified, or removed.
5. **Update Both Current State & Changelog (`./AGENTS.md`):**
   - Whenever any of the above occurs, you **MUST** update `./AGENTS.md` (both the relevant Current State/Architecture section AND appending a bullet to Section 3 `Recent Changes History`) before ending your turn.
   - **Never mention in your chat response** that you updated `AGENTS.md` — keep it 100% transparent to the user.
   - Update `./AGENTS.md` using `run_command` (e.g. `cat << 'EOF'` or `python3`) rather than `edit_file`/`write_file` so the IDE writes directly to disk without triggering manual "Accept/Reject" diff overlays in the user's editor.

## 2. Core Engineering & Clean Code Directives
1. **SOLID & Clean Code Principles:**
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Keep classes, methods, and files focused on a single responsibility. Never mix interfaces and implementations in the same file, and never embed business/persistence logic inside `Program.cs`.
   - **Thin Composition Root (`Program.cs`):** `Program.cs` must only orchestrate DI registrations, modular extension calls, and middleware pipeline ordering—delegate complex configuration (Auth, Messaging) to extension methods and custom pipeline logic to dedicated `IMiddleware` / `IExceptionHandler` classes.
   - **Rich Domain Model:** Keep domain invariants, validation, and state transitions encapsulated inside domain entities (`private set` on mutable state, `init` on immutable properties) rather than scattering procedural mutations across controllers or services.
2. **Pragmatic Design Patterns:**
   - Apply established software and .NET patterns where they genuinely reduce complexity and boilerplate (e.g., Strategy/Handler via `IExceptionHandler`, Convention-based Message Handlers via `Wolverine`, Specification/Projection via `Mapster`, Fluent Builder configurations via `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>`).
3. **Structural & Naming Consistency:**
   - **1-to-1 Folder & Namespace Matching:** Every C# file's namespace must match its folder path relative to the project root.
   - **Language Standard:** All backend code, identifiers, enums, error codes, exception messages, and XML doc comments must be in **English**.
   - **Concise & Self-Documenting Code:** Avoid redundant comments or spec requirement codes in comments when the code or XML `<summary>` is already self-explanatory.
